# Crops in Australia - Agricultural & Weather Analytics

## 🔎 Project Overview

This university project analyses Australian crop production from 1989–2024 and investigates whether temperature and humidity patterns influence crop performance across states.

The dashboard allows users to:
	-	Compare crop yield trends over time by state
	-	Visualise crop distribution across regions using a Sankey diagram
	-	Analyse total production and farming area by crop type
	-	Explore correlations between yield, temperature, and humidity

⸻

## 📦 Data Sources
	- Australian Government — Department of Agriculture (Crop production reports)
	- Kaggle Weather Dataset (regional temperature & humidity data)

Datasets were cleaned and structured in R before being visualised in Tableau.

## 💡 Key Insight

Most crops perform optimally between 10°C–25°C, with Western Australia and New South Wales driving the highest wheat production over the past 35 years.
